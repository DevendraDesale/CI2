# CI2
This one contains the scripts that I wrote for the computational intelligene class. Basically some of the genetic algorithms
and others.

Now to run all these programs you will need to install the following stuff:
- scipy
- numpy
- nltk
- xlrd (for reading data from excel file)

## Topic Modeling
In the topic folder there are couple scripts to test and run topic modeling stuff. There are a corpus of 10 different articles in the folder and are supposed to be tested for document classification.

## Genetic Algorithm
This folder is for the computational intelligence CA. It is about using genetic algorithm to draw fractal shapes and improve the beauty.
