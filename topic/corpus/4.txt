Chile's first Bitcoin exchange, SurBTC, wants to help in the aftermath of the 8.3 earthquake, which is stronger than the recent Nepal and Haiti earthquakes.

“The damage in many fishing villages is devastating. The waves destroyed buildings, including recently rebuilt ones, as not long ago the same part of Chile was struck by another natural disaster,” Guillermo Torrealba, SurBTC CEO, tells CCN. As Chile’s first Bitcoin exchange, SurBTC, has looked into ways to alleviate the situation in the country.

“At SurBTC we have the resources to convert to pesos the bitcoins people donate, so that's what we're doing,” he says. “We've opened an exclusive account for this matter, where every bitcoin will be traded for pesos, and of course, everything, both transactionally and operationally, will be completely free.”  Not only is it a way to help Chile, but it could also help Bitcoin, according to Torrealba.

“We think that this is an excellent way to show the world what Bitcoin can do,” Torrealba says. “This is the type of situation where Bitcoin can flourish.” Ultimately, Bitcoin brings people together - those in need and those with the means to help - quicker than ever.
