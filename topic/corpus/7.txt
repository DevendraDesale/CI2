Christopher Jonathan James Nolan is an English-American film director, screenwriter, and producer. He has directed several of the most acclaimed and commercially successful films of the early 21st century. His nine films have grossed over US$4.2 billion worldwide and garnered a total of 26 Oscar nominations and seven awards.

Having made his directorial debut with Following (1998), Nolan gained considerable attention for his second feature, Memento (2000). The acclaim of these independent films gave Nolan the opportunity to make the big-budget thriller Insomnia (2002), and the mystery drama The Prestige (2006). He found further popular and critical success with the Dark Knight trilogy (2005â€“2012), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). Nolan has co-written several of his films with his brother, Jonathan Nolan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife Emma Thomas.

Nolan's films are rooted in philosophical, sociological and ethical concepts, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His body of work is permeated by metafictive elements, temporal shifts, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling and analogous relationships between visual language and narrative elements. Nolan is described as "one of the most innovative storytellers and image makers at work in movies today", and he is often admired by critics for integrating elements of art film into the blockbuster format.
